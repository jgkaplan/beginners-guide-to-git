You have a graph in R^2 (the xy plane) with points at every pair of integer coordinates
(excluding the origin).

What is the probability that a straight line drawn through the origin passes
through at least one point?

<Hint>
What does it mean for a line to pass through one such point?
</Hint>
<Hint>
Consider the slope of the line.
</Hint>

<Solution>
The probability is 0. Assume the line passes through a point with integer
coordinates. Call these coordinates (x,y). Then the slope of this line is
y/x. This question is equivalent to asking what the probability is that the
slope of this line is rational. Since the irrationals are uncountably infinite,
and the rationals are countably infinite, the probability is that the slope is
rational is 0.
</Solution>
