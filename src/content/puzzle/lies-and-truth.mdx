You come to a fork in the road. One path leads to treasure, and the other path
leads to certain death. You don't know which path is which. In front of the paths
are standing two people. You know that one of them can only tell lies, and
one of them can only tell the truth. You don't know which person is standing
in front of which path.

By asking a single one of the people a single yes/no question, can you figure
out which path will take you to the treasure?

<Hint>
Can you ask a question that they'll both answer in the same way?
</Hint>

<Solution>
Go to the person in front of the first road and ask,
"If I asked the other person if this road led to the treasure, would they
say yes?" If you asked the truth sayer, they will truthfully tell you
that the other person would lie. If you ask the lier, they will lie and say
that the truth teller would lie. Thus, any answer you get here will be a lie.
If the answer is "No", then the first road is the road to the treasure.
If the answer is "Yes", then you want the other road.
