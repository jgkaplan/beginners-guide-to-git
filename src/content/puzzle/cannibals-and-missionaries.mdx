Three cannibals and three missionaries are on one side of a river. There is a small boat that can only hold two at once. To prevent a tragedy, there can never be more cannibals than missionaries in one place.

How do they all get across the river?


<Solution>
In the table below, left side and right side are the different sides of the river.
Direction indicates which way the boat is bringing people.

C = cannibal

M = missionary
