Two prisoners are given a task by a guard.

The guard says, "I will put either a red hat or a blue hat on each of your heads. You won't be able to see your own hat color, but you can see the hat of the other person. Then, I'll pull each of you into a separate room and ask what color your own hat is. If at least one of you gets it right, I'll set you both free. If neither of you get it right, you have to stay in prison. You can come up with a plan now, but once the task starts, you aren't allowed to communicate in any way with eachother."

Come up with a strategy that will allow the prisoners to be set free.

<Hint>
What are the possible ways a prisoner can answer?

- A constant color (e.g. always red)
- A random color
- The color that they see on the other person
- The opposite of the color they see on the other person.

<Hint>
How many different ways can the hats be put on the prisoners?

<Hint>
In the final solution, only one prisoner will get the correct answer.
</Hint>
<Solution>
One prisoner says the color of the hat they see. The other prisoner says the opposite of the color of the hat they see. This works because there are only two scenarios: Either both prisoners have the same hat color, or they each have a different hat color. One prisoner accounts for the first case, and one accounts for the second case.
