White has an interesting mate in 2 moves.

In the puzzle below, it is White to move. Find a way to checkmate Black.

<Hint>
Note that Black has no good moves.
</Hint>

<Solution>
Rook to h1, then any of Black's moves can be answered with a mate.
I think there are probably other stall moves that work too, such as king to h1.
