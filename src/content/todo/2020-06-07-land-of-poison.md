title: "Land of Poison"
tags: other
difficulty: Strong Poison
hints:
    - Try to first find a way to kill both people, then think of a way to save
        one of them.
solutions:
    - The minister of finance drinks a weak poison before going into the room,
        then brings water as his poison. Water, being weaker than any poison,
        since it is not a poison. The minister of potions drinks the water,
        then his strong poison, and dies. The minister of finance drinks the
        strong poison, then the water. He would normally die, but because he drank
        a weak poison before entering the room, he's okay.
    - To counteract this plan, the minister of potions also brings water.
        Then, he drinks water twice, as does the minister of finance. But since
        the minister of finance drank a weak poison beforehand, he now dies.
    - No. The king gets water, not a poison at all.

In the land of poison, things work differently: the only antidote to a poison
is a stronger poison. If you consume a weak poison followed by a strong one,
you'll be completely fine, but if you consume a strong poison followed by a weak
one, you'll still die.

Knowing this, the king of the land of poison wanted to find the strongest poison
in the land. He called upon his two most trusted ministers, the minister of potions
and the minister of finance, and gave them a task. "Each of you will construct
the strongest poison you can make. You will bring this poison into a room, then
drink the other person's poison first, followed by your own. Whoever survives
clearly had the stronger poison, and I will take that and have the strongest poison
in the land."

The minister of finance was very worried, for he knew that the minister of potions
knew very much about poisons and would certainly make a stronger poison. He then
hatched a plan, that would allow him to survive, while the minister of potions dies.
Confident, he proceeded with his plan. However, the minister of potions had a spy
who discovered this plan. The minister of potions then came up with a counter plan
that would allow him to survive, and the minister of finance to die.

So, the three questions are as follows;

1. What was the minister of finance's initial plan?
2. What was the minister of potion's counter plan?
3. Did the king get what he wanted in the end?

Additional information: no tricky business happens inside the room where the poison
drinking happens. Both are alive upon entering the room, and only one leaves.
There is no stealing of the other person's poison required.
