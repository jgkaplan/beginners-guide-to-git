title: "A Strange Mate"
tags: chess checkmate
difficulty: Checkmate level
verify: It's a rook move
solutions:
    - Rook to h1, then any of Black's moves can be answered with a mate.
        I think there are probably other stall moves that work too, such as
        king to h1.
hints:
    - Note that Black has no good moves.
