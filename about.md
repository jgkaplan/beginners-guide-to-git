I like puzzles and riddles, but haven't been able to find a good website that collects
"interesting" ones. This is an attempt to consolidate various puzzles I've tried
and like.

I don't think difficulty ratings make much sense, since different people
think in very different ways, and can see some solutions more easily than others.
Thus all the difficulty ratings given here are both subjective and arbitrary,
and should not be taken too seriously.

When possible, I will try to provide verifications of the solution,
so you can check if your solution is right without revealing a full explanation.
