layout: puzzle
title: "A diamond in the chessboard"
tags: other, computer science
difficulty: 64 squares
solutions:
  - Number each square from 1 to 64 as a 6 digit binary number. XOR the numbers together of all the squares that have coins on heads. XOR that number with the number of the special square. This gives you a new number. Flip the coin on that number square. When your partner comes in, they should XOR the numbers of all the squares that have coins on heads. This number is the number of the special square. This works because XOR is reversible, and flipping the coin of a square is equivalent to XORing by it. In other words, A XOR B XOR A = B. In this case, (heads squares) XOR ((heads squares) XOR (special square)) = (special square)
hints:
  - The exclusive OR operation will be useful to know.

On each square of a chess board, I will place a coin, randomly heads or tails. I choose one square as special, and tell you what it is. You must flip exactly one coin, from tails to heads or heads to tails. Then, you will leave the room, and your friend will be brought in. If they can figure out my special square, just by looking at the chess board, you'll both be given a reward. What strategy can you and your friend use to find the special square?

- The Superposition Coin Super Puzzle Solution
  You have a board with four spaces and a light in the middle
  There are coins hidden in each space, either heads or tails. The light will light up if all coins are heads or all are tails. You have five moves to get the light to light up. Each move consists of picking two spaces, looking at the coins in them, flipping over zero, one, or two of them. After each turn the board is spun so that you do not know which coin is in each position.

- Five pirates are parting ways after finding a treasure of 100 pieces of gold. The pirates decide to split it based on a vote. Each pirate, from oldest to youngest, gets to propose a plan on how to split the gold.
  If at least 50 percent of the other remaining pirates agree on the plan, that is how they will split the gold. If less than 50 percent of the pirates agree, the pirate who came up with the plan will be thrown overboard. Each pirate is smart, greedy, and wants to throw as many others overboard as possible without reducing the amount of gold they get.
  What plan can the first (oldest) pirate propose to live and get as much gold as possible?

- 6 6 6 = n (for n from 0 to 9. make the equations hold using only symbols) (6 + 6 - 6 = 6 is given)
- 3 3 3 = n (n from 0 to 10. Bonus: do 10 in two different ways using only +!())

- you have 8 coins which are identical in appearance
  7 of them weigh the same and one is slightly lighter than all the others
  you have a balance that can be used to weigh the coins (put some on one side, some on another)
  find the lighter coin using the smallest number of weighings you can

- you have 12 coins, identical in appearance
  11 weigh the same but one is either slightly heavier or slightly lighter
  find the coin that's different using the smallest number of weighings you can

  how can you rearrange people to give this guest a room?
  (part 2) An infinite bus arrives, full of a countably infinite number of guests looking for rooms
  how do you fit them all in?
  (part 3) A countably infinite number of infinite buses arrive, each full of a countably infinite number of people in them.
  How do you fit them all in rooms?
