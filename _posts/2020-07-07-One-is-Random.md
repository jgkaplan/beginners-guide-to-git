Can you figure out where the treasure is?
<!--more-->

You come to a fork in the road. One path leads to treasure, and the other path
leads to certain death. You don't know which path is which. In front of the paths
are standing three people. You know that one of them can only tell lies, and
one of them can only tell the truth, and that one of them answers randomly. You don't know which person is which.

You may ask two yes/no questions in an attempt to figure out which path
leads to the treasure. Each question can be directed at only a single person.
Can you figure out which path will take you to the treasure?
