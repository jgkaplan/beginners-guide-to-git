Can you figure out the identity of the three gods?
<!--more-->

There are three gods: one always tells the truth, one always lies, and one answers
randomly. The gods can understand your language, but only respond in their own.
(They have words for "yes" and "no", but you don't know what they are).

By asking three yes/no questions (each question is asked to a single god),
can you figure out which god is which?

Note, the questions must be able to be answered with a "yes" or a "no". No
paradoxes allowed. Assume all gods have knowledge of the future and know how all
the other gods will answer a question.
