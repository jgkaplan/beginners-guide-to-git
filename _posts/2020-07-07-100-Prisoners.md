title: "100 prisoners"
tags: other prisoners math
difficulty: 30%
hints:
    - If every prisoner chose all boxes randomly, they have a 1/2^100 chance of success. If they all choose the same 50 boxes, then they have no chance of success. How can you remove some of the randomness?
solutions:
    - Number the prisoners 1-100 randomly. Each prisoner should first look in the box corresponding to their number. If their name is in the box, they're done. Otherwise, they should look at the name in that box, and go to the box with the number corresponding. Continuing like this until the name is found
    or 50 boxes are reached. This reduces the problem to an analysis of cycles.
    The question is then, what's the probability of having no cycle larger than 50 in a set of 100? This probability turns out to be higher than 30% (around 31.18%). This solution also has been proven to be optimal.

The names of 100 prisoners are placed in 100 wooden boxes, one name to a box.
The boxes are lined up in a room. One by one, the prisoners are brought to the
room. They can look in at most 50 boxes, but must leave the room exactly as they found it, and there is no further communication with the other prisoners.

If all prisoners find their own name, they will all be set free. Otherwise,
they will all be killed.

<!--more-->

The prisoners have a chance to plot a strategy in advance. After this, no more communication can occur between them.

Find a strategy that lets the prisoners live with probability of success
at least 30%.
